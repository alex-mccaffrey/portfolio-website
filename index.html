            <h2>History</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I am a Massachusettes native that transplanted to Colorado in 2009 to start my college career. After completing my degree in Natural Resoruce Tourism at Colorado State University, I began my journey with the Vail Ski Patrol.</li>
               <li>During my time on Patrol, I learned the importance of working as a cohesive unit at all times, and adapting to sudden changes and plans. I have adapted this skill into all aspects of my life, and web development is no different.</li>
               <li>I tend to suceed through sheer grit and determination to be the best that I can. If you have a passion for the outdoors, helping others, or exploring unchartered territory, I would love to work with you.</li>
